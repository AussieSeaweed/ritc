Tips
----

- Minimize the API calls for maximum speed and to minimize the period of time
  your code blocks.
- Look at the source code of ``ritc`` and make changes you think is necessary!
  But, as per the ``AGPLv3`` license the library is under, you must share your
  changes!
- Learn the ins and outs of Python.
- Use simple logic. If a function gets too long or convoluted, you can
  definitely make it simpler! Plus, it reduces the number of potential bugs.
- Will multithreading help speed things up? Marginally, if you know what you are
  doing. Writing Python code that benefits from multithreading is very
  difficult, let alone writing one that actually works. Your time is probably
  better spent optimizing in other avenues.
